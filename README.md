# buildvpn-trojan

This is the project for building VPN with trojan.

Thanks for the contribution of [easytrojan](https://github.com/eastmaple/easytrojan).

Note: I will refine this project at a later date, and it is currently available for deployment using [easytrojan](https://github.com/eastmaple/easytrojan).

## Install

1. Prepare an oversea server with Ubuntu 18+, we call it vps.

2. Prepare a domain name to disguise traffic. (Optional)

3. Download this Repo to your vps.
